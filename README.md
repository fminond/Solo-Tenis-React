# Welcome to my e-commerce proyect

Here I sell products like Raquets to Shorts. It's a *specialize tennis e-commerce*. 

There are 5 categories: 

-Raquets
-Balls
-Shorts
-T-shirts
-Socks

You could navigate through the different categories, looking for the best product option for you.  

Finally, when you have already decided which product/s are you taking with you, Only Tennis present you an *easy cart* where you can finish the checkout. 
You will receive the confirmation with an alert when the purchase is already done. 

In other terms, I have used libraries like bootstrap to create an interesting and stylish nav bar // react-loading and spinners to show the user that the products are being charged to the website. 

Document .env added, but when I tried using the process.envy.name of the variable, unfortunately products doesn't shown on screen. 


I will add here the video using my own website, like a demo of how to use it. https://www.loom.com/share/e4b145bb52694bee8ae012a20b6a6cf5
